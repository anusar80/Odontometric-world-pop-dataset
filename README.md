# Odontometric-world-pop-dataset
Machine-readable mesiodistal and buccolingual crown diameters for 638 world populations indexed by sample, location, period and source. The columns are self-explanatory. Data compiled by Hiroyuki Yamada of Aichi-Gakuin University, Nagoya, Japan. Hope it proves useful to dental anthropologists and other students interested in odontometric variation.
